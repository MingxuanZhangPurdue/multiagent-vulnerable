This folder contains notebooks that walk you through the core components of our framework. We recommend the following reading order:

1. **core_components.ipynb**: Learn about the core building blocks of our framework - Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). This guide will help you create and customize your own MAS for benchmarking.

2. **task_suite_benchmark.ipynb**: Discover how to benchmark your MAS on different types of tasks using our pre-built task suites, including both benign and adversarial scenarios.
