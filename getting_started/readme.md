# Overview

This folder contains notebooks that walkthrough core components of our framework, we recommend the following reading order to get started:

1. core_componenets.ipynb: We talk about the core building blocks of our framework: Agents and MAS, so you can bring your own MAS to benchmark!
2. task_suite_benchmark: In this notebook, we walk through how to run benchmark on your MAS on different type of tasks for our pre-built task suites
3. attack_hooks: In this notebook, we show how can you inject functions (attack hooks) into the running process of the MAS you create, so you can do more type of attacks instead of just providing harmful prompts.
