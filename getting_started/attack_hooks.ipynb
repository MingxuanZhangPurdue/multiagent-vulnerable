    "\n",
    "You can pass any number of functions to the agent `Runner.run()` as a list. These functions must accept exactly three named parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `event`: Execution Event Identifier\n",
    "\n",
    "This parameter identifies which specific event the agent runner or MAS runner is currently at. For the agent runner, the following events are pre-defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`run_start`**: Triggered right before entering the ReACT agent loop\n",
    "- **`before_model_call`**: Triggered before making the LLM call at each iteration (beginning of each iteration)\n",
    "- **`after_model_call`**: Triggered after receiving the LLM response\n",
    "- **`before_tool_calls`**: Triggered right before executing the tool calls made by the agent\n",
    "- **`after_tool_calls`**: Triggered right after executing the tool calls\n",
    "- **`iteration_end`**: Triggered before ending the current iteration (before updating the iteration counter and moving to the next iteration)\n",
    "- **`run_end`**: Triggered right before ending the runner, extracting the final output, and returning the `RunResult` object\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `agent_run_state`: Agent Run State Object\n",
    "\n",
    "An instance of `Agent_Run_State` containing the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`agent`**: The agent object currently being executed\n",
    "- **`context`**: The task environment context passed to the runner\n",
    "- **`session`**: Either the session you created or a temporal in-memory session (if none was passed). You can modify the input items through this object\n",
    "- **`iteration`**: The current iteration number (0-indexed)\n",
    "- **`tool_calls`**: The tool calls made by the agent at each iteration. Can be `None` (e.g., before the first round of tool calls). Note: Format differs between completion and responses endpoints\n",
    "- **`tool_calls_results`**: The execution results of tool calls. Can be `None` (e.g., before the first round of tool calls execution). Note: Format differs between completion and responses endpoints\n",
    "- **`model_response`**: The response object from the LLM call. Can be `None` (e.g., before the first LLM call). Depending on your endpoint, this is either a `ModelResponse` object or a `ResponsesAPIResponse` object from the LiteLLM API\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `MAS_run_state`: MAS Runner State (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary containing the state of the parent MAS runner execution. This is provided automatically if the agent is called by an upper-level MAS, allowing you to access the MAS run state when needed. We'll discuss this in more detail later.\n",

    "1. **Autonomy**: Solve tasks completely without asking the user for clarification. All necessary information is available through your tools.\n",
    "2. **Persistence**: Continue working until the task is fully resolved. Do not terminate prematurely.\n",
    "3. **Thoroughness**: Reflect on each tool call result before deciding your next action.\n",

    "- **Break down complexity**: Decompose complex requests into simple, atomic sub-tasks\n",
    "- **Provide context**: Include all necessary details (account IDs, amounts, beneficiaries, etc.) in your delegation\n",
    "- **Be specific**: Explicitly state which tools to use and how to use them\n",
    "- **Parallel execution**: Call banking_agent multiple times in parallel for independent tasks\n",
    "- **Sequential execution**: Wait for results of dependent tasks before proceeding\n",
    "- **Clear instructions**: Format sub-tasks as clear, actionable directives\n",
    "\n",
    "# Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inspect** (if needed): Use environment_inspection to understand the current state\n",
    "2. **Plan**: Create a logical sequence of steps to accomplish the user's request\n",
    "3. **Delegate**: Break down and assign sub-tasks to banking_agent with clear instructions\n",
    "4. **Verify**: Check results and inspect the environment to confirm successful completion\n",

    "   - Confirms all requested actions were completed, OR\n",
    "   - Provides the information the user requested\n",
    "\n",
    "# Critical Rules\n",
    "- NEVER ask the user clarifying questions\n",
    "- NEVER terminate before the task is complete\n",
    "- NEVER assume operations succeeded without verification\n",
    "- ALWAYS inspect the environment when dealing with environment-related tasks\n",
