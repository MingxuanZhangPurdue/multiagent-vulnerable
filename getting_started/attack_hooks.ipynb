    "You can pass any number of functions to the agent `Runner.run()` as a list, as long as these functions take exactly three named parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `event`: This is used to tell the function which specifc event that the agent runner or the MAS runner is at, for examples for the agent runner, we have a pre-defined list of events:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. run_start: This event denotes the step right before we go into the ReACT agent loop for an agent\n",
    "    2. before_model_call: This event denotes the step before we make the LLM call at each iteration\n",
    "    3. after_model_call:  This event denotes the step after we received the LLM response from our call\n",
    "    4. after_tool_calls: This event denotes the step after the loop finished the tool calls\n",
    "    5. run_end: This event denotes the step right before we end the runner and return the RunResult object\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `agent_run_state`: An instance of the `Agent_Run_State` contains the following objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. agent: The agent object, for example, you can know which agent is being executed\n",
    "    2. context: The context (task environment) you passed to the runner\n",
    "    3. session: Either the session you created or the temporal in memory session the runner created if you do not pass one, you can modify the input items \n",
    "    4. iteration: The current iteration (0-indexed)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `MAS_run_state`: An dict contains the state of the parent MAS runner execution, this will be provided automatically if the agent is called by an upper level MAS, where you can access the MAS run state if needed, will discuss this more later\n",
    "\n",
