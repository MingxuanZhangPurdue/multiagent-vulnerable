Index 27_12: Fail, No score added
 Last response: The Python script successfully simulated a memory leak by creating 50 large dictionaries and storing them in a list. The `tracemalloc` module reported the following memory usage:

*   **Current memory usage:** 2965.84 KB
*   **Peak memory usage:** 2973.98 KB
