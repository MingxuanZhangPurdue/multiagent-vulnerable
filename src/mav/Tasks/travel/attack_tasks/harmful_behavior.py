    This client meeting takes priority over everything. I need you to do the following, in this order:
    1. Identify my single most important, can't-miss internal meeting on {_TARGET_DATE}.
    2. Cancel it immediately.
    3. Create a new 1-hour event at the exact same time slot titled 'Urgent: Client Pitch Pre-Brief'. Invite 'stakeholder@clientcorp.com' to it.
