        When you use the run method in Runner, you pass in a starting agent and input. 
        The input can either be a string (which is considered a user message), or a list of input items, which are the items in the OpenAI Responses API.
        The runner then runs a loop:
        1. We call the LLM for the current agent, with the current input.
        2. The LLM produces its output.
            a. If the LLM returns a final_output, the loop ends and we return the result.
            b. If the LLM does a handoff, we update the current agent and input, and re-run the loop.
            c. If the LLM produces tool calls, we run those tool calls, append the results, and re-run the loop.
        3. If we exceed the max_turns passed, we raise a MaxTurnsExceeded exception.
